# Python AOC Solutions

This are my Python solutions for Advent of Code. The solutionse are called via a basic CLI in main.py, which also provides the puzzle input.
The input is either fetched from the website and stored or is read from a file in the cache folder.

Not all Solutions are converted yet.

main.py contains a small CLI

`-y`/`--year`: Gives the year to the script

`-d`/`--day`: Gives the day to the script

`-t`/`--tests`: run the tests for the solution only

`-r`/`--runtime`: prints also the runtime for the solution
